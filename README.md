# A proposed technical standard for ad transparency

This is a modified version of [Google's "Ad Transparency Spotlight" documentation](https://github.com/Ads-Transparency-Spotlight/documentation). Their proposal is inadequate to cover many of the elements and areas needed to provide true transparency, particularly for political ads (which is our primary interest). However, project served as a reminder that we lack universal technical standards for ad transparency, a problem we are trying to solve here. 

The main purpose is that, with ad transparency firmly on the agenda of the EU's [Digital Services Act](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/proposal-regulation-single-market-digital-services-digital-services-act_en.pdf) and [Democracy Action Plan](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0790&from=EN), the absence of a technical standard creates a lot of unnecessary wiggle room and uncertainty about what data will be in - and out - of scope. The benefit of a single industry standard for ad transparency is obvious - it improves the quality of data available to internet users and for research while reducing the burden on advertising platforms to produce their own formats and data outputs.

## Goal

To create:
- A technical, machine-readable standard for advertising transparency to be used by any advertising platform.
- A means for people to build tools that add context and explanation to the ads people see.
- A universal format, with sufficient flexibility, to allow data from multiple platforms to be combined and compared.

## About

- These documents were created by [Who Targets Me](https://whotargets.me). 
- This is part of our ["Open Political Ad Library" work](https://whotargets.me/opal).
- Our start point was to combine Google's schema, which we saw as something of a start point, with our own ["Gold Standard" for political ad transparency](https://whotargets.me/en/how-to-take-a-gold-standard-approach-to-political-advertising-transparency-and-policy/).
- This is a first iteration (alpha) and can therefore be substantially improved.
